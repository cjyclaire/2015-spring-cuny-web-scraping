## Late Policy Reminder

Every day that an assignment is late is a one letter grade deduction. Work that deserves an A, turned in anytime within 24 hours after the deadline will automatically receive a B. During the next 24 hours it becomes a C, etc.

## How to Turn in Assignments

First, save your code in a file named 'ps1.py', 'ps2.py' or 'ps3.py' depending on which problem set you're completing.

Second, at the top of your code, in a comment, write down the name of the problem set and your name like so:
```python
# Problem Set 0
# Name: Sisi Wei

def example(x):
  print x
```
Finally, email your completed assignment to sisi.wei [at] journalism [dot] cuny [dot] edu.
